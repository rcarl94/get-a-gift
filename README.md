# get-a-gift

## Purpose

I started thinking about how Christmas morning was going to go and I thought it'd be nice to have something to help with taking turns and picking which present to open. This is me and copilot trying to figure that out in Golang.

## Configuration

Configuration is loaded from `config.yml` in the root directory. See config/config.go for the struct.
